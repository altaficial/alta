- **[[Frank Underwood]] ([[Kevin Spacey]]):** [[House of Cards]]' cunning and ruthless politician. His bisexuality adds complexity to his character, hinting at hidden desires and motivations. Is it a tool for manipulation or a genuine aspect of his identity?
    
- **[[Villanelle]] ([[10 Creative/11 Altaficial/content/compost heap/Jodie Comer]]):** [[10 Creative/11 Altaficial/content/compost heap/Killing Eve]]'s stylish and psychopathic assassin. Her fluid sexuality adds an element of unpredictability and danger to her character. Does her bisexuality inform her chaotic nature or is it simply another facet of her complex persona?

**Thinking Out Loud:**

How do these portrayals challenge or reinforce societal perceptions of bisexuality? Do they offer a deeper understanding of the bisexual experience, or do they merely use it as a plot device? Are these characters ultimately empowering or problematic representations of the LGBTQ+ community?
