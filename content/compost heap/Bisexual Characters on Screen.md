- **[[Frank Underwood]] ([[Kevin Spacey]]):** [[House of Cards]]' cunning and ruthless politician.Â Frank's bisexuality is a subtle undercurrent,Â adding another layer to his manipulative tactics.Â Is it genuine or just another tool in his arsenal?Â Frank's character fascinates meâ€”his complexity and cold calculation are chilling yet captivating.
   
- **[[Villanelle]] (Jodie Comer) & [[Eve Polastri]] (Sandra Oh) :**Â The cat-and-mouse duo fromÂ [[10 Creative/11 Altaficial/content/compost heap/Killing Eve|Killing Eve]].Â Villanelle's fluid sexuality mirrors her chaotic nature,Â while Eve's complex relationship with Villanelle blurs the lines between obsession and attraction.Â Their dynamic raises questions about desire,Â danger,Â and the intoxicating pull of the unknown.Â (That scene where Eve visits Villanelle's apartment in Paris?Â Peak tension.Â "I just want to do normal stuff,Â someone to watch movies with,Â a cool job..." ðŸ˜­) I can't help but notice how similar Villanelle and Kalinda Sharma are:Â both are HOT,Â fiercely independent women who use their sexuality strategically,Â leaving me wondering what'sÂ _really_Â going on in their heads.

- **BoJack Horseman:** BoJack Horseman is a self-destructive, washed-up celebrity horse (yes, you read that right). While BoJack's bisexuality is often played for laughs, his relationships are as messy as the rest of his life. It's a more nuanced portrayal that delves into the struggles of addiction and mental health, which definitely resonates with me. I think I've re-watched BoJack more than five times. It's a messy, yet comforting, show.
   
- **Kalinda Sharma (Archie Punjabi):** _The Good Wife_'s enigmatic investigator. Kalinda's bisexuality is just one facet of her complex personality. She's fiercely private, guarded, and uses her sexuality to her advantage at times. But is there more to her than meets the eye?

- **Clarke Griffin (Eliza Taylor):** The 100's resilient leader. Clarke's bisexuality is woven into the narrative, with relationships with both men and women playing significant roles in her journey. It's a reminder that love and attraction aren't always black and white.

- **Kat Edison (Aisha Dee):** The Bold Type's ambitious social media director. Kat's journey of self-discovery as a bisexual woman of color is a highlight of the show for me. It's incredibly relatable, watching her question her identity, navigate the challenges of coming out, and ultimately find a community where she truly belongs. It's inspiring to see a character like Kat embrace her bisexuality with such confidence and vulnerability. The Bold Type is one of the shows that I rewatch multiple times. It's my escape to daydream about my early 20s (I'm still 23, but still). If I could redo that time, I think I would do more things sooner.

- **Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman):** Doctor Who and Torchwood's immortal time agent. Jack's omnivorous sexuality is often the butt of jokes, but it's also a source of his charm and charisma. His character challenges traditional notions of gender and sexuality in a sci-fi setting.

#### Thinking Out Loud:

These portrayals are just a few examples of how bisexuality has been explored on screen. Some might be problematic (looking at you, Frank), while others offer a refreshing take on diverse representation (Kat, definitely). Some are just... complicated, like BoJack, who we love despite his flaws. But one thing's for sure: they all spark important conversations about sexuality, identity, and the challenges of being true to yourself in a world that often tries to put you in a box.

Do these characters challenge or reinforce stereotypes? Do they provide genuine insight into the bisexual experience, or are they just using it as a plot device? Are they empowering or problematic representations of the LGBTQ+ community?
