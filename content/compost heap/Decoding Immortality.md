## The Science, Ethics, and Perils of Eternal Life

[[Tan Malaka]], [[Woody Guthrie]], [[Hedy Lamarr]], [[Marion Stokes]], etc what if their genius minds could be preserved forever?

**Thinking Out Loud:** The question of immortality has long captivated humanity. Now, with AI’s rise, we face a new frontier: Could we not only extend lifespans but potentially digitize our very minds, preserving our greatest thinkers and saving countless lives lost to disease or accidents? The implications are staggering. Imagine a world where Einstein’s genius could continue to spark innovation, or where medical breakthroughs could be accelerated by the collective wisdom of history’s greatest minds.

But what ethical dilemmas arise from such advancements? What happens to the concept of mortality if we transcend it? As we stand on the cusp of this potentially revolutionary leap, one thing is certain: the implications will reverberate throughout society and redefine what it means to be human.
