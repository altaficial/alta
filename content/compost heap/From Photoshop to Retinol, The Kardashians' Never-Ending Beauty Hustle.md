title: "From Photoshop To Retinol: The Kardashians' Never-Ending Beauty Hustle"
---


The Kardashians have basically been the poster children for unrealistic beauty standards for, like, ever. Photoshop, plastic surgery, shady diet teas... you name it, they've probably done it (or sold it).

Now, they're having a public meltdown about the pressures of looking perfect. Remember that episode of _The Kardashians_ where Kylie was all emo about her body and face? And Kendall's response was just pure savage hilarity? Yeah, that's the one.

I mean, I'm not saying we should throw a pity party for Kylie. But the whole thing is kinda ironic, right? They built their empire on making everyone feel "less than" unless they have a face full of filler and a waist snatched to the gods. Now they're _surprised_ that people are struggling with body image? ðŸ™„

### Blueprint to Disaster? Longevity Bros and the K Klan

To make things even more sus, they're now hanging out with Bryan Johnson and Andrew Huberman, the dudes who are all about anti-aging and biohacking. Seriously? Did they not get the memo about the whole problematic Kardashian past?

Look, I'm not against the pursuit of longevity. I'm down for living a long, healthy life, and I definitely don't want to be a fossil by 30. I've even dabbled in some biohacking myself, checking out Bryan Johnson's Blueprint protocol a while back. 

But these guys are taking it to a whole other level. They're basically science experiments with endless supplements, pricey treatments, and bodies that are like walking labs. I'm not knocking the whole biohacking thing, [[Decoding Immortality|I do want that too]], but can we maybe chill a bit? There's a difference between taking a multivitamin and injecting yourself with who-knows-what. Let's prioritize health and safety over hype and hasty decisions. We can all strive for longevity, but maybe with a bit less... mad science? We don't want anyone turning into a real-life Benjamin Button because they followed some questionable advice from a reality TV star.

Now, the Kardashians are probably gonna make it all trendy. Ten-year-olds were already begging for retinol last Christmas, so who knows what kind of wild beauty treatments they'll be demanding this year? Glutathione injections, anyone? Thanks a bunch, Kris.

### Bottom Line: It's Not Just About Hating on the Kardashians

Look, I'm not trying to cancel the Kardashians (again). But we gotta hold them accountable, you know? They've got a massive influence, especially on young girls. If they're gonna start preaching about health and longevity, they need to do it responsibly. No more promoting toxic diet culture or pushing unproven products.

Maybe Taylor Swift was onto something when she said, "You don't get to complain about being famous if you put yourself in that position." The Kardashians chose this life, actively sought the spotlight and shaped beauty standard, so their complaints now feel a bit hypocritical. They need to own the consequences â€“ both good and bad.

It's not about hate, it's about critical thinking. We can still enjoy their reality TV drama, but let's not forget to question their motives and the messages they're sending. After all, we don't want a generation of kids growing up thinking they need to look like a filtered Instagram photo to be happy, right?
