Grey's Anatomy is one of my ultimate comfort show, hands down. I've rewatched the entire series a mind-blowing ELEVEN times. It's my go-to when I need a good cry, a dose of drama, or just a familiar escape. The characters feel like old friends, and the storylines never fail to pull me in. It's a perfect blend of heartwarming moments, gut-wrenching tragedies, and everything in between.

And can we talk about the Post-it note? Like, that's my love language right there. It was such a simple yet iconic moment, and it just made the whole relationship between Meredith and Derek even more special. I'm a sucker for grand romantic gestures, and this one definitely tops the list.

If I had to pick a favorite character, it would be Christina Yang without hesitation. She's not your typical TV doctor; she's ambitious, confident, and unapologetically herself. Her wit and sarcasm are on point, and her friendship with Meredith is the epitome of ride-or-die. Plus, who can forget her iconic line, "He's very dreamy, but he's not the sun. You are."? Pure gold. Christina embodies the strong, independent woman we all aspire to be.

Speaking of suns, this quote is especially hilarious for me because I have traditional Mentawai tattoos on both of my shoulders – one of the oldest designs in the world, and guess what? They're suns! So basically, Christina and I are tattoo twins, and she's constantly reminding me that I'm the sun. It's a little bit of extra validation from my fictional bestie.

One of the things that makes Grey's Anatomy so captivating is the endless fan theories. Some believe the entire show is just Meredith's dream (a dark and twisty one, for sure). Others think everyone is secretly in a coma after the plane crash. And then there's the theory that the hospital is actually purgatory, where deceased characters reunite. These theories might sound crazy, but they're a testament to the show's dedicated fanbase and the endless possibilities it presents.

Even Taylor Swift, the queen of pop herself, is a self-proclaimed Grey's Anatomy fan. She's referenced the show in her music and even named one of her cats after Meredith Grey. If it's good enough for Tay, it's definitely good enough for me!
