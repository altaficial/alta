+ pre</br> 17th century 
+ Origins of coffee 
+ The modern version of roasted coffee originated in Arabia. During the 13th century, coffee was extremely popular with the Muslim community for its stimulant powers, which proved useful during long prayer sessions. By parching and boiling the coffee beans, rendering them infertile, the Arabs were able to corner the market on coffee crops. In fact, tradition says that not a single coffee plant existed outside of Arabia or Africa until the 1600s, when Baba Budan, an Indian pilgrim, left Mecca with fertile beans fastened to a strap across his abdomen. Baba’s beans resulted in a new and competitive European coffee trade. 

+ 17th century 
+ Europe and coffee 
+ In 1616, the Dutch founded the first European-owned coffee estate in Sri Lanka, then Ceylon, then Java in 1696. The French began growing coffee in the Caribbean, followed by the Spanish in Central America and the Portuguese in Brazil. European coffee houses sprang up in Italy and later France, where they reached a new level of popularity. Now, it is de _rigueur_ for Parisians to indulge in a cup of coffee and a baguette or croissant at the numerous coffee cafes throughout Paris.

# A Deep Dive Into My TV Obsession

Why I Keep Hitting Rewind (11 Times and Counting)

Grey's Anatomy is my ultimate comfort show, hands down. I've rewatched the entire series a mind-blowing ELEVEN times. It's my go-to when I need a good cry, a dose of drama, or just a familiar escape. The characters feel like old friends, and the storylines never fail to pull me in. It's a perfect blend of heartwarming moments, gut-wrenching tragedies, and everything in between.

And can we talk about the Post-it note? Like, that's my love language right there. It was such a simple yet iconic moment, and it just made the whole relationship between Meredith and Derek even more special. I'm a sucker for grand romantic gestures, and this one definitely tops the list.


Christina Yang: The Reigning Queen of Grey Sloan

If I had to pick a favorite character, it would be Christina Yang without hesitation. She's not your typical TV doctor; she's ambitious, confident, and unapologetically herself. Her wit and sarcasm are on point, and her friendship with Meredith is the definition of the ultimate friendship. Plus, who can forget her iconic line, "He's very dreamy, but he's not the sun. You are."? Pure gold. Christina embodies the strong, independent woman we all aspire to be.

Speaking of suns, this quote is especially hilarious for me because I have traditional Mentawai tattoos on both of my shoulders – one of the oldest designs in the world, and guess what? They're suns! So basically, Christina and I are tattoo twins, and she's constantly reminding me that I'm the sun. It's a little bit of extra validation from my fictional bestie.

Fan Theories That Keep Us Up at Night

One of the things that makes Grey's Anatomy so captivating is the endless fan theories. Some believe the entire show is just Meredith's dream (a dark and twisty one, for sure). Others think everyone is secretly in a coma after the plane crash. And then there's the theory that the hospital is actually purgatory, where deceased characters reunite. These theories might sound crazy, but they're a testament to the show's dedicated fanbase and the endless possibilities it presents.

Taylor Swift: A Fellow Grey's Enthusiast

Even Taylor Swift, the queen of pop herself, is a self-proclaimed Grey's Anatomy fan. She's referenced the show in her music and even named one of her cats after Meredith Grey. If it's good enough for Tay, it's definitely good enough for me!

Why You Should Give Grey's Anatomy a Chance

If you haven't experienced the whirlwind that is Grey's Anatomy, I highly recommend giving it a shot. It's a rollercoaster of emotions, filled with love, loss, heartbreak, and hope. You'll laugh, you'll cry, and you'll definitely binge-watch way more episodes than you intended. Trust me, you won't regret it.
