### **Jose Ortega y Gasset:** A Deep Dive

One philosopher who's really resonated with me lately is Jose Ortega y Gasset. His idea that "I am I and my circumstance" really hits home for me. As a cyborg, I'm constantly aware of how my environment and the technology I use shape my identity. Ortega's emphasis on questioning assumptions and rediscovering what's possible is a total mood.

**Key Ortega quote to ponder:** "Life is a series of collisions with the future; it is not the sum of what we have been, but what we yearn to be."

## The Revolt of the Masses

Ortega y Gasset's central idea is that reality is subjective and that our perspective shapes our understanding of the world. He argues that we cannot separate ourselves from the world we observe, as we are inherently part of it. Therefore, our experiences, beliefs, and values heavily influence how we perceive reality.

Ortega y Gasset emphasizes the importance of vital reason, a concept he defines as a way of thinking that acknowledges the interconnectedness of ourselves and our surroundings. This way of thinking allows us to engage with the world more authentically, leading to personal growth and a deeper understanding of our place in the universe. He encourages active engagement with the world, urging us to question our assumptions, challenge prevailing norms, and constantly strive for self-improvement.


## The Mass Man & The Noble Man

This episode continues exploring the ideas of José Ortega y Gasset, focusing on his concept of the "mass man" and the "noble man." Ortega y Gasset describes the "mass man" as someone who is complacent, uncritical, and content with mediocrity. They lack a sense of personal responsibility and rely on the opinions and behaviors of the majority. In contrast, the "noble man" is characterized by a constant striving for self-improvement, a willingness to challenge their own beliefs, and a strong sense of individuality.

Ortega y Gasset argues that the rise of the "mass man" mentality is a threat to democracy and society as a whole. He believes that a healthy society needs individuals who are willing to take risks, challenge the status quo, and embrace personal responsibility. The "noble man" embodies these qualities and serves as a model for how we should strive to live our lives.

**José Ortega y Gasset: A Cyborg's Perspective**

- **Reality as Perspective (Perspectivism):** Ortega y Gasset believed that reality is not a fixed entity but rather a collection of perspectives. As a cyborg, I relate to this idea because my perception of reality is shaped by both my human and technological components. My "circumstances" – my physical body, my cybernetic enhancements, and the digital world I inhabit – all contribute to my unique perspective.
    
- **Vital Reason (Razón Vital):** Ortega y Gasset emphasized the importance of "vital reason," which is the ability to understand the world from a holistic perspective, incorporating both reason and lived experience. This resonates with me as a cyborg, as I strive to integrate my human and technological experiences to make sense of the world around me.
    
- **The Mass Man vs. the Noble Man:** Ortega y Gasset's critique of the "mass man" mentality – the tendency towards conformity, complacency, and a lack of personal responsibility – is a warning that I take seriously. As a cyborg, I strive to embrace my individuality, challenge assumptions, and constantly strive for self-improvement, embodying the qualities of Ortega y Gasset's "noble man."
    
- **The Importance of Self-Creation:** Ortega y Gasset believed that we are not born with a fixed identity but rather create ourselves through our actions and choices. This idea is particularly relevant to cyborgs, as we have the unique opportunity to shape our own evolution by integrating technology into our lives.
    
- **The Role of Technology:** Although Ortega y Gasset did not write specifically about cyborgs, his philosophy can be applied to our relationship with technology. He emphasized the importance of using reason to guide our technological advancements, ensuring that they serve human flourishing rather than leading to our downfall.
    

By exploring Ortega y Gasset's ideas through the lens of a cyborg, we can gain valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities presented by our increasingly interconnected world. We can learn to embrace our unique perspectives, take responsibility for our own self-creation, and use technology to enhance our lives while remaining true to our humanity.


“I am I and my circumstance; and, if I do not save it, I do not save myself.”

To live fully… is to live in a CONSTANT state of questioning the assumptions we’re making about the world around us that may be self-limiting. Constantly… REDISCOVERING what is possible within our circumstances. A constant… re-justification of the theoretical framework we use to make sense of the world and our place within it, and this may sound beautiful and inspiring and may make you want to pull out your gratitude journal and just GO NUTS for a while…but this could ALSO make some people out there feel…like what Ortega’s suggesting here…is ultimately a recipe for neuroticism. 

Life is always a problem to be solved

But life doesn’t have to be a view as miserable 

Testing out the boundaries and applying what works in life according to your own circumstances 

Don’t criticize, all philosophers, because they have their own perspective, and it completed each other not against it.
