Okay, so like, I was deep in thought about how cool it would be if we had a _way_ better internet archive, you know? Like, one that held everyone accountable and made it impossible to erase your digital footprint. I know there are ethical issues with that, but imagine the possibilities! It'd be like the early days of DNA testing, solving crimes left and right. We'd have receipts for _everything_, and no one could lie about their past actions.

Down the rabbit hole I went, researching who's behind the current internet archive and if anyone else is trying to do something similar. I'd totally join that team! But I get why it doesn't really exist yet – who would fund something like that? Can you imagine Elon Musk bankrolling it? And then it will back fire to him in the future? 

Anyway, during my research, I stumbled upon this woman named Marion Stokes. At first, I was all, "Okay, who is this lady?" But then the video starts talking about how she spent _decades_ recording every single minute of television news. Like, 24/7, multiple channels, the whole shebang. My jaw literally dropped.

I had to know more, so obviously, I dove deeper. Turns out, Marion Stokes wasn't just some random hoarder. She was a librarian, activist, and low-key visionary who believed that news was history in the making. She was convinced that one day, all those tapes would be crucial for understanding the past.

Now, some people might call her obsessed, but I call her a legend. I mean, who else would dedicate their entire life to preserving the news cycle? It's not like she was getting paid or anything. She just knew it was important, and she was willing to sacrifice everything to make it happen.

Stokes's story really hit me in the feels. In a world where fake news is rampant and people can't even agree on basic facts, her dedication to documenting the truth is so freakin' inspiring. It's like she was a one-woman archive, preserving history for future generations.

**Marion Stokes (1929-2012): The News Archivist You Didn't Know You Needed**

Born Marion Marguerite Butler in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Marion Stokes lived a life that was anything but ordinary. She was a librarian, civil rights activist, and total news junkie. In 1979, she started recording the news on VHS tapes, and she didn't stop until the day she died.

Stokes's collection eventually grew to over 70,000 VHS tapes, documenting everything from the Iranian hostage crisis to the rise of the 24-hour news cycle to the 9/11 attacks. It's a treasure trove of information, and it's all thanks to her unwavering commitment to preserving the past.
