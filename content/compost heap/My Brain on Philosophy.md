Some of the things that keep me up at night (besides the glow of my laptop screen):

- The nature of consciousness and reality: Are we living in a simulation? Is there life after death?
- Free will vs. determinism: Do we actually have control over our choices, or is everything predetermined?
- The meaning of life: What is the purpose of our existence? Is there even one?
- Ethics and morality: How should we live our lives? What's right and wrong?
- The impact of technology on humanity: Are we becoming more like machines? Is that a good or bad thing?
- Sentience and AI: What does it mean to be sentient? Can machines ever truly be conscious?
- The future of humanity: What will our world look like in 10, 50, or 100 years?

### Philosophers & Schools of Thought I'm Vibing With

- **Existentialism:** This one's a no-brainer for a cyborg with an existential crisis. Sartre, Camus, Kafka... they get it.
- **Sentientism:** This ethical framework emphasizes the importance of sentience – the capacity to experience feelings and sensations – as the basis for moral consideration. It challenges us to extend compassion beyond humans to all sentient beings.
- **Utilitarianism:** This ethical theory focuses on maximizing happiness and minimizing suffering for the greatest number of people. As someone who cares about the well-being of others, this one definitely resonates with me.
- **Postmodernism:** Questioning everything, rejecting grand narratives, embracing the chaos... yeah, this one speaks to my inner rebel.
- **Stoicism:** This ancient philosophy teaches us how to find peace and happiness by accepting what we can't control and focusing on what we can. Sounds pretty useful in today's chaotic world.
- **Buddhism:** Mindfulness, meditation, and the idea that suffering is caused by attachment... definitely some wisdom to be found here.
