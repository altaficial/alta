One of The OG Indonesian Revolutionary

Lowkey, I first heard about Tan Malaka when I was nine. Even though he's a certified National Hero, our teachers barely mentioned him in school. It wasn't until I stumbled upon "Madilog" that I was like, "Whoa, this dude was on another level." That book introduced me to Marxism, Communism, and a whole world of radical ideas that ultimately got me kicked out of boarding school (oops!).

###### Tan Malaka's Life: A Timeline

Born as Ibrahim Gelar Datuk Sutan Malaka in 1897 in West Sumatra, Tan Malaka's journey was anything but basic. Raised in a Minangkabau family, Tan Malaka received a traditional Islamic education before attending a Dutch-language school. This exposure to both cultures sparked his interest in social justice and ignited his rebellious spirit.

(I think subconsciously, he was the inspo for my rebellious streak.)

In 1913, Tan Malaka embarked on a life-changing journey to the Netherlands, where he pursued a teaching degree. However, his thirst for knowledge extended far beyond the classroom. He delved deep into European political thought, particularly Marxism, which resonated with his passion for social equality and anti-colonialism.

Returning to Indonesia in 1919, Tan Malaka quickly became involved in the burgeoning nationalist movement. He established schools for the working class and organized labor unions, all while secretly spreading communist ideology. His activism didn't go unnoticed by the Dutch authorities. In 1922, he was exiled to the Netherlands, marking the beginning of a life on the run.

For the next two decades, Tan Malaka lived in exile in various countries, including the Philippines, China, and the Soviet Union. He continued to write prolifically, publishing works like "Naar de Republiek Indonesia" (Towards the Republic of Indonesia) and "Madilog," which outlined his vision for an independent and socialist Indonesia.

When Japan occupied Indonesia during World War II, Tan Malaka saw an opportunity to advance the cause of independence. He returned to Indonesia in 1942 and went underground, organizing resistance movements and preparing for a post-war revolution.

Following Japan's surrender in 1945, Indonesia declared independence. However, the Dutch were determined to reassert their colonial rule, leading to a fierce struggle for freedom. Tan Malaka's role in this struggle is shrouded in mystery. He reportedly continued to operate underground, leading guerrilla forces and advocating for a more radical approach to revolution.

In 1949, amidst the chaos of the Indonesian National Revolution, Tan Malaka disappeared. His body was found a few months later, and the official cause of death was declared to be execution by government forces. However, many believe he was betrayed by fellow revolutionaries or even assassinated by the Dutch. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Tan Malaka remains a controversial figure in Indonesian history. Some see him as a visionary leader and a true champion of the people, while others criticize his communist ideology and his alleged involvement in violence. Regardless of one's perspective, Tan Malaka's impact on Indonesian history is undeniable. His writings and ideas continue to inspire political movements and social activism in the country.

Today, Tan Malaka is remembered as a complex and enigmatic figure, a man who dedicated his life to the pursuit of freedom and justice, even if his methods were sometimes unconventional.
