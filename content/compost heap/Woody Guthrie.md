Legit, Woody Guthrie was my first musical obsession, way before I even knew what folk music was. Growing up, my great-grandpa would blast "This Land is Your Land" on his old radio and I'd sing along at the top of my lungs. I didn't understand the depth of his lyrics back then, but the melodies were catchy AF. It wasn't until I was older that I realized how much his music reflected the struggles of everyday people, especially during the Great Depression.

**Woody Guthrie's Life: A Timeline**

Born Woodrow Wilson Guthrie in 1912 in Okemah, Oklahoma, Woody's life was a wild ride. He grew up during the Dust Bowl, witnessing firsthand the devastation caused by the drought and economic hardship. This experience shaped his worldview and fueled his passion for social justice.

In his early twenties, Woody hit the road, traveling the country and hopping freight trains. He lived among migrant workers and the homeless, sharing their stories through his music. His songs resonated with people who were struggling to make ends meet, giving them a voice and a sense of hope.

In the 1930s and 40s, Woody's music career took off. He recorded albums, performed on the radio, and wrote a semi-autobiographical novel called "Bound for Glory." He also became involved in political activism, using his music to support labor unions and fight against fascism.

Unfortunately, Woody's life was cut short by Huntington's disease, a degenerative neurological disorder. He spent his final years in the hospital, but his music lived on. His songs continued to be sung and celebrated by generations of musicians and activists.

Woody Guthrie remains an iconic figure in American music history. His simple yet powerful lyrics captured the struggles and triumphs of everyday people, making him a true voice of the people. Even today, his music continues to inspire and uplift those who hear it.
