In today's hyper-connected world, it's easy to find ourselves chronically online, our lives intertwined with the constant stream of information, notifications, and social interactions that the digital realm offers. As a self-proclaimed [[cyborg girl]], I've embraced technology as an extension of myself, but I'm also acutely aware of the potential pitfalls of this always-on lifestyle. The internet, once a utopian vision of interconnectedness, increasingly feels like a dark forest[^1] – a place where we tread carefully, wary of spam bots, trolls, and the overwhelming noise of information overload.

Being chronically online[^2] is basically the default setting for Gen Z. We're the generation that grew up with smartphones glued to our hands, social media feeds refreshing every five seconds, and a constant stream of notifications buzzing in our pockets. It's like we're living in a 24/7 digital party where FOMO is the bouncer who never lets us leave.

But let's be real, this non-stop connection can take its toll. It's a double-edged sword: on one hand, we have access to a universe of information, communities, and creative expression. On the other, it's easy to get sucked into the vortex of endless scrolling, doomscrolling,[^3] and the pressure to always be "on."
###### What Does It Mean to Be Chronically Online?

Being chronically online is more than just spending hours on the internet. It's a state of mind where we feel tethered to the digital world, even when we're not actively using our devices. It's the urge to check our phones for notifications, the fear of missing out (FOMO), and the endless scrolling through social media feeds.

While it can provide a sense of connection and access to information, it can also lead to:

- **Information overload:** The constant bombardment of news, opinions, and clickbait can be overwhelming and anxiety-inducing. It's like trying to drink from a firehose – too much, too fast.
- **The comparison trap:** Social media often presents a highlight reel of others' lives, making it easy to fall into the trap of self-doubt and comparison. It's a toxic recipe for low self-esteem and a distorted view of reality.
- **The attention-span black hole:** Constantly switching between apps and notifications can wreak havoc on your focus and make it harder to get things done. It's like your brain is a browser with a million tabs open, and none of them are loading properly.
- **Sleep deprivation:** The blue light emitted from our screens messes with our sleep hormones, making it harder to fall asleep and stay asleep. Who needs beauty rest when you can have dark circles and a caffeine addiction, right? (Wrong.)
- **IRL isolation:** When you're constantly plugged in, it's easy to neglect your real-life relationships and miss out on the simple joys of being present in the moment.


###### Taking Back Control: Tips for a Healthier Digital Life

But don't worry, it's not all doom and gloom! Here are some tips I've picked up along the way for creating a more balanced and intentional relationship with technology:

- **Digital Minimalism:** Marie Kondo your digital life! Delete apps you don't use, unsubscribe from email lists that clutter your inbox, and set limits on your screen time. Think of it as a detox for your digital soul.
- **Find Your Focus:** Experiment with different techniques to improve your focus and attention span. Try the Pomodoro Technique (25 minutes of focused work followed by a 5-minute break), timeboxing your tasks, or using website blockers to eliminate distractions. Your brain will thank you.
- **Embrace the Offline World:** Make time for activities that don't involve screens. Go for a walk in nature, read a physical book, create art, or spend quality time with loved ones. Remember, there's a whole world out there beyond the confines of your phone.
- **Curate Your Feed:** Unfollow accounts that make you feel bad about yourself or contribute to your anxiety. Follow artists, creators, and thinkers who inspire you and make you feel good.
- **Create, Don't Just Consume:** Use technology to express your creativity and connect with others. Start a blog, make art, write poetry, or join online communities that share your interests. Don't just be a passive consumer of content; be an active participant in the digital world.
