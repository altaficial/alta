Part human, part machine—that's the cyborg girl. Honestly, it's kinda how I feel most days, seamlessly integrated with my devices and the endless scroll of the digital world. We're living in an era where tech isn't just a tool we use, it's like an extra limb, a "second brain", a part of us. Our smartphones are practically glued to our hands, social media is our virtual playground, and wearable tech is tracking our every step (and heartbeat!).

But what does it really mean to be a cyborg in the 21st century? Are we low-key already there? And how do we use all this tech to make our lives better without losing ourselves in the process? Or is evolving beyond human just the next step?

I'm diving deep into all this cyborg stuff and the whole human/tech relationship in this corner of my digital garden. Get ready for random musings, maybe even a full-blown existential crisis or two as I try to figure it all out. I'm gonna question everything and explore the crazy possibilities (and maybe dangers?) of our tech-infused existence.

Oh, and speaking of cyborgs... my friend @renaldoptrs and I created this illustration way back for (Al)ta 1.0. You might notice the Tank Girl inspo here.

Then we redesign it to (Al)ta 3.0 (peep the new tattoo), but 2.0 was less techy because we were going for more of a nature/reputation vibe.

###### Cyborgs: Not Just Sci-Fi Stuff Anymore

When you hear the word "cyborg," you probably picture futuristic beings with robotic limbs and glowing eyes, straight out of _Ghost in the Shell_ or _The Terminator_. But the truth is, the cyborg concept is way more complex and closer to reality than you might think.

Technically, a cyborg is any being with both organic and biomechatronic parts.[^1] That means folks with pacemakers, cochlear implants, or even prosthetic limbs are all part of the cyborg club. But it goes beyond just physical enhancements.

The real cyborg revolution is happening in our minds and social lives. We're so reliant on our devices for everything – communication, navigation, information, even emotional support – that the lines between human and machine are getting seriously blurred. It's like we're all becoming one with the algorithm.

###### Cyborg: Cultural Icon or Existential Threat?

Cyborg has become a powerful cultural icon, reflecting our hopes and fears about the future. We see them as cool, powerful beings who can transcend human limitations. They represent the potential for us to enhance our abilities, create a more equitable and inclusive society where everyone has access to the tools and technologies they need to thrive, overcome disabilities, and even (maybe?) achieve immortality.

But there's a darker side to the cyborg narrative, too. It's the fear of losing control to technology, becoming too dependent on machines, and sacrificing our humanity for the sake of progress. It's the classic sci-fi trope of AI taking over the world, except it's not so far-fetched anymore.

###### My Life as a (Wannabe) Cyborg

As someone who's chronically online, I can't help but see myself as a cyborg-in-training. My smartphone is my lifeline, my laptop is my portal to infinite knowledge, and my wearable tech is constantly tracking my movements, fitness, heartbeat, and who knows what else. My social media accounts are my digital personas. It's a constant struggle to balance the convenience and connection of tech with the need to disconnect and just be, like, a human.

I love how tech makes things easier and keeps me in the loop, but it's also exhausting. The constant distractions, the pressure to be always available, and the blur between online and IRL life can be a lot. It's a complicated relationship, and I'm constantly figuring out how to find that sweet spot where I can use tech without it using me.
###### Cybernetic Compendium :

- **Books:**
    -  _The Cyborg Manifesto_ by Donna Haraway: This feminist classic explores the cyborg as a metaphor for breaking down traditional boundaries and challenging power structures. It's deep, thought-provoking, and still super relevant today.
	- _Simians, Cyborgs, and Women_ by Donna Haraway: Another Haraway gem that dives deeper into the relationship between humans, animals, and technology. It's a must-read for anyone interested in feminist theory and cyborg studies.
	- _How We Became Posthuman_ by N. Katherine Hayles: This book takes a critical look at how technology is changing our understanding of what it means to be human. It's a bit of a head-scratcher, but it'll definitely make you think.
	- Life 3.0 by Max tegmark: This mind-blowing exploration of AI and the future of humanity dives into the implications of creating superintelligence. It's a wild ride through the possibilities (and potential dangers) of what happens when technology surpasses human intelligence. Think philosophical questions, mind-bending scenarios, and a whole lot of "OMG, what if?" moments. Even if you're not a sci-fi nerd, this book will make you question everything you thought you knew about the future.

- **Comics and Graphic Novels:**
	- **Tank Girl (Jamie Hewlett and Alan Martin):** Tank Girl is a punk rock anti-heroine who lives in a tank and doesn't take crap from anyone. She's basically the definition of "I do what I want," and definitely my inspo. Her unapologetic attitude, wild style, and love for chaos are a total vibe.
	- **Lazarus (Greg Rucka and Michael Lark):** Forever Carlyle is a genetically engineered warrior who's all about protecting her fam in a dystopian world. She's got the skills and the loyalty, and she's not afraid to get her hands dirty.

- **Films:**
    - _Alita: Battle Angel_: This cyberpunk action film tells the story of Alita, a cyborg with a mysterious past who is found in a scrapyard and rebuilt. (When this movie came out, lots of my friends, team, and even clients asked me if I was Alita. Like, I know I'm a cyborg, but no, I didn't write the movie, LOL.)
    - _Ghost in the Shell_ (1995): This anime classic is a visual feast for the eyes and a philosophical mind trip. It explores the questions of identity, consciousness, and what it means to be human in a world where the line between man and machine is blurring.
	- _The Terminator_ (1984): A dystopian action flick that will definitely give you nightmares about AI. But it's also a classic for a reason – it taps into our deepest fears about technology and the potential for it to turn against us.
	- _Ex Machina_ (2014): This psychological thriller delves into the ethics of artificial intelligence and the potential consequences of creating sentient machines. It's a slow burn, but it'll leave you questioning everything.
	- _Upgrade_ (2018): In a near-future where technology controls nearly all aspects of life, a technophobe named Grey Trace is paralyzed in a freak mugging that leaves his wife dead. He accepts an experimental computer chip implant named STEM that allows him to walk again and gives him superhuman abilities. Although I prefer the original book, the movie is still entertaining.
	- **Battlestar Galactica:** This science fiction series follows the survivors of a devastating attack by the Cylons, a race of intelligent machines created by humans. 

- **Articles and Websites:**
    - Cyborg Anthropology: This emerging field of study examines the cultural and social implications of human-technology interactions. It's a fascinating look at how technology is shaping our lives and our identities.
    - The Cyborg Foundation: This organization advocates for the rights of cyborgs and promotes the integration of technology into our lives. They believe that we are all already cyborgs, whether we realize it or not.
    - The Transhumanist Party: This political party supports the use of technology to enhance human capabilities and overcome biological limitations. They envision a future where humans can transcend their physical and mental limitations and become something more than human.

The cyborg question is just getting started, and it's only going to get more complex as technology advances. Are we ready for a future where the line between human and machine becomes even more blurred? Only time will tell.
