No cobwebs or creaky floorboards here, just a curated collection of the books that have shaped my cyborg brain. From classic philosophy to mind-bending sci-fi, these are the reads that have challenged my thinking, sparked my imagination, and generally made me a more interesting person (or so I like to think).

## Seedlings (Antilibrary)

This is where I nurture the seeds of future knowledge, aka the books I haven't gotten around to yet but am low-key excited aboutt. It's a constant reminder that I'm still figuring things out. Instead of being all smug about what I _do_ know, my [antilibrary](https://nesslabs.com/antilibrary) is more about the stuff I'm still curious about. It's like a roadmap to all the cool things I haven't explored yet.

## Harvest (Read)

These are the fruits of my labor, the books that have already borne their knowledge and wisdom. It's a mix of old favorites, recent discoveries, and everything in between. Each one has left its mark on me in some way.
