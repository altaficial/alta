## Revamping the BlueDot Project Phase (Product Manager - Bluedot Impact Work Test)

- **Situation:** BlueDot's Project Phase was experiencing low student engagement and project submission rates. Only 30% of students were submitting projects, and of those, only 40% met the quality standards. Students reported feeling overwhelmed and unsupported during the transition from the Learning Phase to the Project Phase, struggling to translate their theoretical knowledge into practical application.  
- **Task:** My task was to analyze the existing Project Phase, identify pain points in the student journey, and develop solutions to improve student engagement, project submission rates, and the overall quality of student projects.  
- **Action:** To address the challenges, I created a Student Journey Map to understand the student perspective and design targeted interventions.

- **Situation:** YesHello needed a consistent and organized approach to content creation to effectively engage our target audience, maintain a strong brand presence, and support marketing campaigns.
- **Task:** Develop and implement a content calendar to plan, schedule, and track the creation and distribution of various content types (blog posts, social media updates, etc.).
- **Action:** I collaborated with the marketing team to identify key themes and content formats. I developed a comprehensive content calendar using Notion, created engaging content (blog posts, social media updates, infographics, etc.), and established a consistent publishing schedule. I also monitored content performance, analyzed key metrics, and made data-driven adjustments to optimize the content strategy.
- **Result:** The content calendar improved the consistency and effectiveness of YesHello's content marketing efforts. It ensured a steady flow of valuable content that engaged our target audience, supported marketing campaigns, and strengthened the brand's online presence. It also facilitated better planning, collaboration, and content quality, enabling data-driven decision-making to optimize content strategy and achieve better results.
