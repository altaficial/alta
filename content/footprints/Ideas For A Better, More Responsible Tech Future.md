This corner of the internet is where I let my thoughts run wild about the intersection of tech and our world. Some of these ideas might spark a sense of déjà vu, and that's okay! It's impossible to claim complete originality these days. But I can say with confidence that these ideas were born from my own experiences and musings. If you've been toying with similar concepts, have seen something like this out there, or simply want to collaborate, hit me up. I'm all about building tech that doesn't just exist, but actively contributes to a better world (universe(s)?).

**AI Safety Check: Keeping AI on the Right Track**

AI is evolving at a breakneck pace, and we need to ensure it doesn't veer off course. Think of this as a safety net for AI, catching those "oops" moments before they snowball into full-blown catastrophes. We're talking a platform where AI safety researchers can flex their skills, ensuring AI development stays ethical and beneficial for all sentient beings. Transparency and open-source tools are non-negotiable – we're leaving shady practices in the dust.

Imagine a platform like Scale AI or Outlier AI, but with a laser focus on AI safety.

**Mapping the AI Jungle**

The internet can feel like a wild, untamed jungle (dark forest area), and AI is making it even more unpredictable. We need a map to navigate this digital wilderness, highlighting the safe paths and warning us of potential dangers. Imagine an interactive platform that exposes unsafe AI practices and empowers the community to hold developers accountable.

**Sustainable Travel: Guilt-Free Globetrotting**

Bali is a paradise, but the weight of overtourism is taking its toll. The traffic, the waste... it's heartbreaking. We need to rethink travel, making it sustainable and eco-conscious. Picture an app that tracks your carbon footprint, suggests greener travel options, and champions local experiences over those cookie-cutter tourist traps. I'm sure we can explore the world without leaving it worse off than we found it.

**Superfood Revolution: AI-Powered Farming**

Climate change is wreaking havoc on Bali's/the world's food supply. We need to empower farmers with AI-driven tech that can withstand any weather extremes Mother Nature throws our way, from droughts and floods to anything else. And let's not just focus on survival – let's create superfoods that can nourish the entire planet. Imagine a future where everyone has access to nutritious food, no matter what.

**Drone Force: Cleaning Up Our Mess**

Every time I hit the beach, the lakes, the trails, even the rice fields here in Bali, I'm bummed out by the amount of trash I see. It's a global issue that needs a high-tech solution. What if we could deploy AI-powered cleanup drones to autonomously identify and collect trash, keeping our environment pristine? And hey, maybe a little AI-powered trash-throwing-back action will make people think twice before littering! And hey, maybe a little AI-powered 'trash boomerang' action will make people think twice before littering!

**Carbon-Negative Construction: Building a Greener Future**

I recently stumbled upon a picture of Bali from the 80s, and it was mind-blowing how different it looked. Even compared to just five years ago, the landscape has transformed drastically. Construction is non-stop, with new coffee shops, boutiques, and spas popping up everywhere. It's obvious that traditional construction is contributing to the climate crisis.

What if we could change the game and develop building materials that actively suck CO2 out of the atmosphere? Imagine buildings that fight climate change instead of making it worse. This isn't just about being eco-conscious; it's about building the sustainable cities of tomorrow.
