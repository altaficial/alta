I believe in the power of collaboration and mutual support. That's why I'm offering a time exchange program for those working in responsible innovation, AI safety, and impact-driven startups.

**Here's the deal:**

For every 1 hour of your time, I'll give you 2 hours of mine.

# How I Can Help You

## Focus & Productivity:

- Be your accountability buddy, helping you stay focused and achieve your goals.
- Ensure your "life work" (e.g., bills, chores, etc.) is taken care of, freeing up your time and mental energy.
- Guide focus-enhancing experiments, such as app testing, environmental design, and selective outsourcing.
- Set up an optimal "digital mind" (exocortex) to store all your knowledge, tasks, and ideas.
## Digital Design & User Experience:

- Review and update your website to improve its user experience and impact.
- Help you revamp your social media presence.
- Provide feedback and guidance on any design-related challenges.
## Wellness & Emotional Support:

- Offer expert emotional support around coming to terms with AI risk.
- Help you plan self-care activities on a regular basis.
- Connect you with therapists or mental health professionals as needed.

# How You Can Help Me

- Share [[Body of Work|my portfolio]] and [[Solutions I Craft|services]] with your network.
- If you know anyone who could benefit from my skills and experience, please introduce us.
- If you've worked with me before, please provide feedback on my work and consider referring me to others.
- I'm always keen to learn and grow, and I would appreciate any mentorship or guidance you can offer.
- If you have any projects that align with my skills and interests, I'd love to collaborate with you.

I'm deeply committed to using my skills for good, and I believe this time exchange program is a unique way to amplify our impact. If you're passionate about responsible innovation and creating positive change, I invite you to trade time with me. I'm excited to see what we can achieve together, one hour at a time!
