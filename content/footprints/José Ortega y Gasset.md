One philosopher who's really resonated with me lately is Jose Ortega y Gasset. His idea that “I am I and my circumstance; and, if I do not save it, I do not save myself”[^1] really hits home for me. As a [[cyborg girl]], I'm constantly aware of how the world around me, especially the tech I use, shapes who I am.

Ortega's philosophy is a siren call for the curious, a challenge to ditch autopilot and question everything. He believes that living fully means constantly poking at the boundaries of our assumptions, rediscovering the possibilities hidden in plain sight, and evolving our understanding of the world and our place in it.

```poetry
"Life is a series of collisions with the future,
it is not the sum of what we have been, but what we yearn to be"
—José Ortega y Gasset
``` 

In Ortega's view, reality isn't some objective truth out there waiting to be discovered. It's a kaleidoscope of perspectives, each shaped by our individual experiences and beliefs. He points out that we're not separate from the world around us, but an integral part of it. Our beliefs, values, and lived experiences totally influence how we see and interact with reality.

He champions "vital reason,"[^2] a way of thinking that acknowledges this interconnectedness. It's about engaging with the world authentically, fostering personal growth, and understanding our place in the universe. He's all about questioning assumptions, challenging norms, and embracing a journey of continuous learning and reflection. This concept of "vital reason" resonates deeply with the idea of a [[Virtual Greenhouse|digital garden]], a space for cultivating ideas and nurturing growth through active engagement and self-reflection.

## The Mass Man vs. The Noble Man

In _The Revolt of the Masses_,[^3] Ortega contrasts the "mass man" - someone who is complacent, uncritical, and content with mediocrity. They lack a sense of personal responsibility and rely on the opinions and behaviors of the majority. In contrast, the "noble man" is characterized by a constant striving for growth, a willingness to challenge their own beliefs, and a strong sense of individuality.

Ortega's "mass man" isn't just about socioeconomic class; it's a mindset, and it's _everywhere_ in today's world. Think about it: the endless scroll of copy-paste content, the toxic "alpha male" culture, the dark forest of the internet where everyone's out for themselves—it's all "mass man" territory.[^4]

Ortega argues that the rise of the "mass man" mentality is a threat to democracy and society as a whole. He believes that a healthy society needs individuals who are willing to take risks, challenge the status quo, and embrace personal responsibility. The "noble man" embodies these qualities and serves as a model for how we should strive to live our lives.


**José Ortega y Gasset: A Cyborg's Perspective**

- **Reality as Perspective (Perspectivism):** Ortega believed that reality is not a fixed entity but rather a collection of perspectives. As a cyborg, I relate to this idea because my perception of reality is shaped by both my human and technological components. My "circumstances" – my physical body, my cybernetic enhancements, and the digital world I inhabit – all contribute to my unique perspective.
    
- **Thinking with Your Whole Being (Vital Reason):** Ortega emphasized "vital reason," the ability to understand the world through both reason and lived experience. This resonates with me as a cyborg, as I integrate my human and technological experiences to make sense of the world around me.
    
- **The Mass Man vs. the Noble Man:** Ortega's critique of the "mass man" mentality – the tendency towards conformity, complacency, and a lack of personal responsibility – is a warning that I take seriously.
    
- **The Importance of Self-Creation:** Ortega y Gasset believed that we are not born with a fixed identity but rather create ourselves through our actions and choices. This idea is particularly relevant to cyborgs, as we have the unique opportunity to shape our own evolution by integrating technology into our lives.
    
- **The Role of Technology:** Although Ortega y Gasset did not write specifically about cyborgs, his philosophy can be applied to our relationship with technology. He emphasized the importance of using reason to guide our technological advancements, ensuring that they serve human flourishing rather than leading to our downfall.

Looking at Ortega y Gasset's ideas through my own cyborg lens has been a total trip. It's given me valuable insights into the crazy, interconnected world we live in. It's reminded me to embrace my unique perspective as a [[cyborg girl]], to own my evolution, and to harness technology in a way that amplifies my humanity, not diminishes it.

- your cyborg girl, alta :)
