Nomads SkillShare and Giving Back! is a vibrant community of global citizens passionate about learning, sharing, and making a difference. I was drawn to their mission of empowering individuals to "live the life they imagined" through skill-sharing, education, and social impact. As Head of Programs, I had the opportunity to shape the organization's growth and contribute to its inspiring vision.

My love for crafting impactful learning experiences, building community, and streamlining processes fueled my work at Nomads. Whether it was designing engaging user journeys or creating a comprehensive knowledge base, I was driven by a desire to empower individuals and foster a thriving community.

Here's a closer look at the key areas where I contributed to Nomads SkillShare & Giving Back!:

## **Program Development & User Experience**

- **Leading the User Journey:** From day one, I was passionate about understanding how users experienced the Nomads SkillShare program. We conducted user research, developed detailed user personas, and mapped out their journeys to identify pain points and opportunities for improvement. This user-centric approach allowed us to create a seamless and engaging experience, from onboarding to program completion.
- **Business Model Innovation:** I led brainstorming sessions and facilitated a revamp of the organization's business canvas model. This helped clarify our focus, identify key partnerships, and ensure our activities aligned with our mission and values.
