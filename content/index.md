Welcome to my digital garden!
```
Consider this a [[Virtual Greenhouse]] where I nurture my curiosity. I'm Alta, a [[creative generalist]] with an insatiable thirst for knowledge and a passion for building a future where technology serves humanity, not enslaves it. Think of me as your [[chronically online]] [[cyborg girl]] (it's in the name, after all—(Al)taficial, get it?), always plugged in, absorbing info like it's my lifeblood – from shitposts to deep dives, podcasts to live streams, watching sci-fi to reality shows. But it's not just about mindless consumption. I'm all about using technology for good—increasing individual freedom, promoting, exploring [[mental-health|mental health]], [[philosophy|philosophy]] and tackling [[existential-risks|existential risks]] like [[ai-safety|AI safety]] As someone deeply invested in [[design-thinking|design thinking]], I'm committed to contributing toward a future marked by [[responsible-innovation|Responsible Innovation]].

My brain? A chaotic kaleidoscope of ideas, forever connecting the dots between seemingly random stuff. It's both a blessing (hello, creativity!) and a curse (brain overload, anyone?). Seriously, though, who needs sleep when you can stay up all night and dissect the latest Taylor Swift theory? (Yes, I'm kinda convinced we're living in a simulation, and she's the mastermind behind it all. jk). But this hyper-connectedness isn't always a good thing. It's like we're living in the [dark forest era of the internet](https://maggieappleton.com/ai-dark-forest). Where the sheer volume of information and content can feel overwhelming, even suffocating. Generative AI only adds fuel to the fire, blurring the lines between reality and fiction. It's a wild, wild world out here, and navigating it requires a trusty compass and a sturdy pair of boots.

For me, that compass is my love for wildlife. Living in my cozy little cave, surrounded by greenery, lakes, and the occasional snake (yep, you read that right), I often find myself pondering the parallels between nature and the digital world. Watching the local farmers meticulously tend to their crops reminds me of Mark Bernstein's essays on "[Hypertext Gardens](https://www.eastgate.com/garden/Enter.html)." Just as farmers nurture their land, I nurture this digital garden as my sanctuary for learning, reflection, and oversharing (in a healthy way, I promise). After trying countless productivity tools, from Evernote to Tana, I always come back to Obsidian, drawn to its offline-first, markdown format, customizable nature, and overall Obsidian philosophy speak for itself. It perfectly captures the tangled web of my thoughts, just like the roots of a thriving garden. This digital space is where I spill the tea on my thoughts, projects, and curated collection of resources.

Meander along these virtual pathways, you may stumble upon hidden groves of knowledge or even find a fertile spot to plant a seed of your own. You can follow these trails to unearth the depths of my digital wilderness:

- [[garden-gate|Garden Gate]]: Step through this gate, and you'll find a whimsical world of inspiration. It's where new ideas sprout and blossom, fueled by curiosity and a dash of wonder.
- [[lakeside|Lakeside]]: This is my creative sanctuary, where ideas come to life. It's where I craft things I'm proud of and where my most treasured beliefs and long-term visions take root.
- [[Blackwood Bookshelf|Blackwood]]: No cobwebs or creaky floorboards here, but this is where I stacked my well-worn books, both old and new, that have shaped my perspective on the world.
- [[tea|Mad Woman's Tea Party]]: Pull up a chair, grab your favorite mug, and let's spill the tea. This is where I share a curated collection of my favorite/juicy reads, perfect for sipping a cup of tea and letting your mind wander.

PS The whole "garden" metaphor isn't just for show. It's about nurturing ideas, watching them grow, and sharing the harvest with others. Plus, it's a gentle reminder that even the messiest gardens can still be beautiful.

P.P.S. Oh, and if you're wondering why Taylor Swift seems to pop up in my musings every now and then, well, she _is_ the soundtrack of this digital garden. She's always singing about secret gardens in her mind, which, to me, feels like a kindred spirit connection to my own digital gardening adventures. Plus, those lyrics about planting a memory garden and escaping to gardens in her mind to live out her fantasy life? Total Dark Forest vibes. And they made me think more about my theory that we live in a simulation created for her amusement. (Listen to "The Lakes," "I hate it here," "Ivy," "Seven," "The Archer," and "The Great War" for the full immersive experience.)
