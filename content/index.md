Welcome!
```

Welcome to my tiny corner on the internet, a personal space on the World Wide Web dedicated to what I'm interested in, filled with what I'm **[reading](https://altaficial.com/mosaic)**, **[listening](https://altaficial.com/mosaic)**, **[bookmarking](https://altaficial.com/mosaic)**, **[writing](https://altaficial.com/writings)**, **[watching](https://altaficial.com/mosaic)**, and **[working on](https://altaficial.com/projects)**. My name is Alta - a creative generalist who loves to craft and build things and tries to use technology for a multitude of noble purposes: increasing individual freedom, promoting mental health, delving into philosophy, extending the human lifespan, ensuring the safety of Artificial Intelligence, and reducing Existential Risks. As someone deeply invested in Design Thinking, I'm committed to contributing towards a future marked by **Responsible Innovation.**



My daydream lately is trying to figure out how to crack the human brain to make learning as irresistible as scrolling through Instagram and as easy as binge-watching your favorite shows.
