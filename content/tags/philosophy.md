description: As a chronically online cyborg girl, I can't help but ponder the big questions of life, the universe, and everything. What's the point of it all? What does it mean to be human (or partially machine) in this crazy world? This section is where I dump all my philosophical thoughts and musings, drawing inspiration from ancient wisdom, modern thinkers, and even the occasional pop culture reference. Think of it as my evergreen notebook of existential pondering.
